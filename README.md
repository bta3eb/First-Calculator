# First-Calculator
My first coded calculator with exponent, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction functionalities.

Right now I'm just starting out coding, trying to get the basics down and get into some more sophisticated logical structures. I coded this as a fourth year Biology student at the University of Virginia.
